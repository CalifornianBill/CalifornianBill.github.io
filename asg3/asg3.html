        <h3>Simple Story:</h3>
        <p>
          This rendition of a California mission ruins in a cube world captures the overall layout and structure although simplified for the brick world. The mission is composed of rectangular buildings, and a central courtyard, all built with uniform cubes. Openings represent doors and unfortunately the way the assignment is designed, windows are not possible, while the layout includes enclosed spaces, and a surrounding boundary wall. The environment is minimal, focusing on shape and symmetry to evoke the essence of the mission without relying on detailed textures or specific materials.
